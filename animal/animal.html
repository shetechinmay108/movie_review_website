            Animal Review:</h1><br>
          <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
          font-size: 1.25vw; margin-left: 30px; font-weight: 400;"> Blood is thicker than water according to the film’s protagonist. The safety and unity of family is sacrosanct no matter how twisted the relations. We are even led to believe that dysfunctional is better than broken.
              <br><br>

              Through an exhausting runtime of 3 hours, 21 minutes, comprising extreme bloodshed, testosterone and blatant misogyny, writer-director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, known for his controversial statements and thoughts, glorifies the alpha male once again through his Godfather-esque tale.
              <br><br>
              When his father is shot, Vijay declares himself as the ‘man of the house’ and takes matters into his own hands. He assures his father that he’ll safeguard their steel empire and family’s legacy but revenge first.
                <br><br>
                Despite anger and daddy issues, he has an active love life. He seduces Geetanjali (Rashmika Mandanna), through his toxic macho traits and erratic, inappropriate humour. “Don’t call me bhaiyya. I don’t have brotherly feelings for you.” He compliments her childbearing hips and like Christian Grey, whisks her away in his private jet for some high-altitude dom/sub love making. “You were the bottom, you didn’t have to do much”, he comments after. He even expects her to forgive his infidelity because she forgives his other crimes anyway. “Aap log mahinay ke chaar din pad badalne par bolte ho, main din mein chaar baar pad badal raha hu”, he argues post an injury, questioning women’s right to complain about period pain.
                <br><br>
                Pop culture has often glorified bad boys. There’s always something attractive about people who refuse to toe the line. Vanga takes this romanticisation a bit too far. Even as his take on women and violence unsettle you immensely as a viewer, those are his preferences for a protagonist as a director, and he is free to have them. The bigger issue is the lack of purpose in the story. His gun-wielding angry young man comes across as a rebel without a cause.
                <br><br>
                Cocky, broken, and problematic characters can be celebrated if they have a reason strong enough to explain the mayhem, if not justify. Vijay has none and in the absence of it, Animal ends up as all swag and no substance derailed family drama. What is fuelling his fire and the rage within? The father-son discord that forms the crux of the story itself stays unexplored. Barring Ranbir, the story barely invests in other characters, turning them into silent spectators, including the very talented Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol. AK is excellent in the confrontational scenes and Bobby looks menacing, but both have very little to do. Women are submissive puppets. Mandanna’s Hindi dialogues are harder to comprehend than the film’s intention.
                <br><br>
                The action feels like an interruption but has been shot well. Ranbir-Bobby fight sequence exudes the intensity of Troy’s iconic Hector-Achilles hand-to-hand combat scene. The background score and music work well with the mood of the film.
                <br><br>
                ‘Animal’ relies heavily on Ranbir Kapoor’s talent and stardom. His raw sex appeal and unmatched intensity are the film’s highlights. One of the finest actors of this generation, you find yourself trapped in his troubled mind as his blood-soaked eyes seethe with rage. Uninhibited, his ability to become the character he plays, shocks, stuns, and draws you in each frame. RK lends that dangerously unpredictable quality to this deranged character and aces it especially in that Vaastav-like crucial climax scene. He deserved a better script to match this level of performance.
                <br><br>
                Ranbir Kapoor can be Joaquin Phoenix but Animal’s no Joker. This entire film could have just been a conversation between the father and his son.<br><br>
