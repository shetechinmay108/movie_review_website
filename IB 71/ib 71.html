          <h1 >IB 71 Review:</h1><br>
            <p >  In recent years, a spate of films has emerged showcasing the exceptional prowess of Indian Intelligence teams on the silver screen. From “Baby” to “Akbar Walter Romeo,” and most recently, “Mission Majnu”- these films have unearthed tales of audacious exploits by Indian Intelligence officers that were previously unknown to us. However, “IB 71” goes a step further by delivering a riveting plot and a well-crafted film. Drawing inspiration from real events, “IB 71” delves into the prelude to the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, when East Pakistan transformed into Bangladesh. The makers deserve praise for selecting this extraordinary chapter from the history of Indian Intelligence, which at times seems almost unbelievable. This action thriller is a gripping cinematic experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The events in the film unfold thick and fast, tightly centered around the operation conducted by the Intelligence team, making it an engrossing watch.
          <br><br>
          “IB 71” unfolds with the intensity of a Hollywood thriller, wasting no time in getting to the crux of the matter and maintaining focus on the core plot throughout its duration. It is commendable that the makers opted to forego song placements for the majority of the film, thus ensuring its momentum (although there is one song towards the end). Any musical number would have undoubtedly hindered the film's pace. The daring exploits depicted in the film exude authenticity rather than a clichéd cinematic portrayal. The art direction and cinematography of this film deserve special mention, as they create a magnificent backdrop that transports viewers back to India in 1971. The sequences set in Dal Lake are breath-taking, with aerial shots capturing its beauty like never before. 
          <br><br>
          The film revolves around Dev Jammwal (Vidyut Jammwal), an intelligence officer who receives critical information about Pakistan and China's impending attacks on Indian soil within a mere ten-day timeframe. With limited time and resources, the only viable strategy to counter this threat is by implementing an airspace blockade. Dev presents his audacious plan to his superior, NS Awasthi (Anupam Kher), which involves orchestrating the hijacking of an Indian plane by Kashmiri separatists and ensuring its landing in Pakistani territory. Initially dismissed as an implausible scheme by the government, they eventually recognize its potential and agree to execute the well-structured operation. Complications arise when the entire team of passengers, comprising intelligence officers, find themselves lodged in a Lahore hotel, and events unfold in an unforeseen manner, deviating from the original plan.
          <br><br>
          Vidyut Jammwal portrays his character with utmost control and restraint. Apart from two action sequences, Vidyut relies more on his acting skills and delivers a sincere performance. The noteworthy aspect is that this time he receives ample opportunities to showcase his acting chops, which he accomplishes with finesse. Anupam Kher reprises a role that he has mastered in the past, and once again, he excels in it. However, it is Vishal Jethwa who truly shines in the film, portraying the character of Qasim. As a restless Kashmiri separatist, he delivers a commendable performance, balancing both cruelty and unintentional humour. Sankalp Reddy takes the director's seat, providing crisp and focused direction. However, it is the film's background score that will certainly detract viewers from an otherwise exhilarating experience. The loud and overpowering background music becomes jarring and overwhelming at times. If only the film had opted for a more restrained approach to the background music, the impact would have been heightened significantly.
          <br><br>
          “IB 71” is an engaging watch that sheds light on a remarkable chapter of history, instilling a sense of pride in our intelligence network. With a runtime of nearly two hours, the film maintains a screenplay that keeps the audience captivated throughout, ensuring there is never a dull moment. If you have an affinity for period action thrillers, this film successfully checks the boxes.
